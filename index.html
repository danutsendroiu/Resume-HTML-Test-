        <h2>Summary
            <h3>
            <p>I am a person always interested in new things and willing to learn and use the latest technologies.</p>
            <p>I am very open and always want to be surrounded by people with whom I can increase the level of knowledge, but at the same time I like to share my knowledge with others.</p>
            <p>I recently started to learn and develop my knowledge related to the IT sector, which I have been doing with great interest for more than a year. Most of the time I study alone, but I also attended specialization courses in the field.</p>
            <p>I really want to be able to perform in this field, and I am especially interested in the testing branch for both applications and web pages, both for manual testing and for automatic testing.</p>
            <p>In the future, I want to deepen the Front-end and Back-End branches, so that with time I can migrate to the area of Full Stack Developer.</p>
